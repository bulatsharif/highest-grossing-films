        <h2>Understanding Box Office Performance</h2>
        <p>
            Films generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, 
            home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office 
            earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, 
            mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video 
            and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, 
            but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong 
            interest in the superhero genre, with eleven films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring 
            among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, <strong>Avengers: Endgame</strong>, 
            is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart.
        </p>

            Animated family films have performed consistently well, with Disney films enjoying lucrative 
            re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such as 
            <strong>Frozen</strong> and its sequel, <strong>Zootopia</strong>, and <strong>The Lion King</strong> (along with its remake).
